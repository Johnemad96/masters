| Algorithm | Pros | Cons | Suitable for | Open Source Availability | Possible Implementation Link | Difficulty to Implement (1-10) | Average Complexity Analysis |
|-----------|------|------|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Grid Search | Simple to understand and implement. Exhaustive search ensures that the best parameters within the grid will be found. | Computationally expensive. Not efficient for large number of parameters. | Small number of parameters | Yes | [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) | 1 | O(n^d) where n is the number of grid points for one parameter and d is the number of parameters |
| Random Search | More efficient than grid search for large number of parameters. Easy to implement. | No guarantee to find the best parameters. | Both small and large number of parameters | Yes | [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html) | 1 | O(n) where n is the number of iterations |
| Genetic Algorithm (GA) | Can handle complex search spaces. Good balance between exploration and exploitation. | More complex to implement and understand. May converge to local optima. | Both small and large number of parameters | Yes | [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) | 6 | O(g*n*log(n)) where g is the number of generations and n is the population size |
| Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) | Can handle complex search spaces. Good balance between exploration and exploitation. | More complex to implement and understand. Less mature and tested than other methods. | Both small and large number of parameters | Yes | [WOA](https://github.com/7ossam81/EvoloPy) | 7 | O(n) where n is the number of iterations |
| Bayesian Optimization | Can find better solutions with fewer evaluations. Good for expensive evaluation functions. | More complex to implement and understand. Requires choosing a surrogate model and an acquisition function. | Both small and large number of parameters | Yes | [Hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/), [Spearmint](https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint) | 8 | O(n) where n is the number of iterations |
| Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) | Can handle both continuous and discrete parameters. Good for expensive evaluation functions. | More complex to implement and understand. | Both small and large number of parameters | Yes | [Hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/) | 8 | O(n) where n is the number of iterations |
| Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) | Can handle complex search spaces. Good balance between exploration and exploitation. | More complex to implement and understand. May converge to local optima. | Both small and large number of parameters | Yes | [pyswarm](https://github.com/tisimst/pyswarm) | 7 | O(n) where n is the number of iterations |
| Simulated Annealing (SA) | Can handle complex search spaces. Can escape local optima. | More complex to implement and understand. Performance depends on the cooling schedule. | Both small and large number of parameters | Yes | [simanneal](https://github.com/perrygeo/simanneal) | 6 | O(n) where n is the number of iterations |
